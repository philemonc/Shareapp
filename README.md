	SmartCrate is a web application that enables people to lend or borrow items that they own. 
	These items fall under four broad categories (tools, appliances, furnitures and books). 
	The items can be loaned for a fee or free. In this web application, users can put items up 
	for loan or they can scroll through the available stuffs so that they can borrow it. As soon 
	as the bids for an item is collected, the best bid is determined by the owner of the item. 
	Aside from users, administrators of this web application can create, modify and remove items.
	
	The application is built on Bitnami WAPP (Windows, Apache, PostgreSQL, PHP) Stack which can 
	be downloaded from https://bitnami.com/stack/wapp/installer. Once installed, load the 
	SQL Data Definition Langauge in ProjectDDL.sql into the PostgreSQL database and run the appplication.
